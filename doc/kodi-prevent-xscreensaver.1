.SH DESCRIPTION
kodi-prevent-xscreensaver (referred to as xpx from here on out) simply sends an `xscreensaver-command \fB-deactivate\fP` if kodi is running. This action will cause xscreensaver to pretend that there has been user activity such as keyboard or mouse activity. The command is sent once every 49 seconds while kodi is running. Why 49 seconds? Some users have xscreensaver configured to activate after 60 seconds of inactivity. Since xscreensaver and xpx have no mechanism to sync with each other, the only way to guarantee functionality is to have xpx cycle faster than xscreensaver.
.SH EXAMPLE USAGE
Run the script at startup or at login. For example, simply link the included kodi-prevent-xscreensaver.desktop to your user's ~/.config/autostart or do so via whatever GUI-based start-up manager you use.
